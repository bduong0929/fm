# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Java

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Java.

## Requirements

- Basic knowledge of Java programming language
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

## Steps

1. **Setup your Java development environment**

   Make sure you have the JDK installed and your IDE set up.

2. **Create a new Java class**

   In your IDE, create a new Java class. You can name it `RockPaperScissors`.

3. **Define the game logic**

   Your task is to implement the game logic for Rock, Paper, Scissors. Here are some steps to guide you:

    - Import the necessary libraries. You'll need `java.util.Scanner` for user input and `java.util.Random` to generate the computer's choice.

    - In the `main` method, create a `Scanner` object to read the user's choice.

    - Create an array of `String` to store the possible choices: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

    - Generate a random index to select the computer's choice from the array.

    - Print the computer's choice to the console.

    - Implement the rules of the game to determine the winner. Remember, Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both the user and the computer make the same choice, it's a tie.

4. **Track the game statistics**

   Add functionality to keep track of the number of games the player and the computer have won, lost, and drawn. You'll need to create variables to store these counts and update them after each game.

5. **End the game and display statistics**

   After each game, ask the player if they want to continue playing. If they choose to stop, end the game and display the game statistics. This should include the number of games the player and the computer have won, lost, and drawn.

6. **Run your program**

   After implementing the game logic and the additional tasks, save your file and run your program. You should be able to play the game by entering your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) when prompted, and see the game statistics when you choose to stop playing.

## Conclusion

Once you've completed these steps, you'll have created a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Java that also tracks and displays game statistics. This is a great exercise to practice your Java programming skills and learn how to manage game states and user interactions. Don't hesitate to add more features to the game and make it your own. Happy coding!
